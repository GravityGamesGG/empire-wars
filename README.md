# Empire Wars

A persistent 3-faction territory war game mode for Hytale with strong economic and logistic systems.

Empire Wars is a month-long persistent multiplayer war where three factions compete for dominance. Players commit to a single faction and work together to destroy enemy monuments while protecting their own. Features include:

- **Player-driven economy** – All equipment is crafted and transported by players
- **Family system** – Form groups to cooperate, share resources, and build cities
- **Territory control** – Build fortifications, outposts, and automated defenses
- **24/7 persistence** – The war continues around the clock with permanent consequences
